1
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:19,723
For a century, the wall stood
as a bastion of peace and security.

2
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,129
We no longer had to live in fear.

3
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,662
People grew accustomed
to living like cattle.

4
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,632
Then…

5
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:51,095
The Titans destroyed what we
had taken for granted.

6
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,429
The battle for humanity had begun.

7
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,509
Death reigned, claiming the lives
of soldiers and civilians alike.

8
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,576
The losses were staggering.

9
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:10,216
Even more shocking was the fact that
Titans were hiding among us.

10
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:12,632
Five years after the fall
of Wall Maria…

11
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:17,185
we managed to capture
one of those creatures alive.

12
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,428
A fellow soldier, Annie Leonhart.

13
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,725
And yet…

14
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:41,025
As the smoke from the battle cleared,
the next threat emerged.

15
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,271
What in…
- Guys, look.

16
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,042
What is that?

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,523
It's a Titan.

18
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:07,727
Inside the wall?
- Impossible.

19
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,640
Section Commander, your orders?

20
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,810
I don't know.

21
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,356
Is this just a coincidence?

22
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,710
Oh no, this doesn't mean…

23
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,856
Pastor Nick?

24
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,981
Listen to me.

25
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:37,237
Whatever you do, keep it out
of the sunlight.

26
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:16,957
THE BEAST TITAN

27
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,980
For now, we've covered the Titan
with sheets.

28
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:26,208
It seems to be sufficient.
We'll take extra measures tonight.

29
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,743
Understood.

30
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,354
Excuse me, but what are we
supposed to make of all this?

31
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:34,503
Never thought there'd be
Titans inside the wall.

32
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,627
Why would you? No one did.

33
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:41,523
A select few knew,
the rest were left in the dark.

34
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,126
Why aren't they saying anything?

35
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,454
This is a huge discovery.
What's the point of keeping it secret?

36
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,161
That's how it is.

37
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,923
The leaders keep everything secret.

38
00:04:56,814 --> 00:05:01,895
All this chaos, and they couldn't
even come up with a good excuse.

39
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,718
Okay, what's going on?

40
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,830
Why a Titan?

41
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:19,572
Why is the Titan inside the wall?

42
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,964
And why would you keep it a secret?

43
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,621
I want answers, and I want them now.

44
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,840
There's no time for this,
I'm busy enough as it is.

45
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:39,422
My flock has been devastated.
I demand compensation.

46
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,173
Do you know who I am?

47
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,393
Let me down this instant.

48
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,632
If you insist…

49
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,205
Straight down alright?

50
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,421
Commander.
- Wait.

51
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,947
Let me ask you something.

52
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:02,294
Do you have any idea how many Scouts
have died because of these monsters?

53
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,762
More than you can count.

54
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:07,523
They died for your freedom.

55
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,322
I was with them.

56
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:12,802
I was prepared to give my life.

57
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,619
You're going to talk,
or you're going to fly.

58
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,188
I can always move on to the next
loudmouth who wants to challenge me.

59
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:27,147
They probably know a lot
more than you do anyway.

60
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,022
Let go of me.

61
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,700
That's what I was about to do.
- Then do it.

62
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,178
Don't test me.
- Don't.

63
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,858
You think I'm afraid to die
for my faith?

64
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,667
We do our duty,
no matter the cost.

65
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,941
I don't care,
the Lord is my shepherd.

66
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:52,331
Drop his humble servant.

67
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:58,989
Lord, deliver me.

68
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,529
Don't be so serious,
it was just a joke.

69
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,595
Come on, Pastor Nick,
tell us.

70
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:21,991
Are all the walls made of Titans?
At least tell me that.

71
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,627
Section Commander?

72
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:30,408
How long has it been since
I've felt this way?

73
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,689
Probably when I first went
outside the walls.

74
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:42,045
Talk about terrifying.

75
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,744
Quick, I have to tell
Commander Erwin.

76
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,153
The Titans have breached Wall Rose.

77
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:11,677
TWELVE HOURS EARLIER.

78
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:16,407
WALL ROSE - MINAWI DISTRICT

79
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,779
You know, my village is just
a little south of where we are now.

80
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,614
Oh, my village is pretty close too.

81
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,225
Why can't I go see my family?

82
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,876
Maybe I'll sneak away once it's dark.

83
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,881
I wasn't allowed to go home until
I was back to normal, so…

84
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:45,157
My parents always used to say
I was too small to be a soldier.

85
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:50,555
I was smart enough, though.
Top of my class, almost.

86
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:53,533
Someone's gonna eat their words.

87
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,866
If you want, I can help you.

88
00:08:57,992 --> 00:08:59,690
Oh yeah? Why would you?

89
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,796
Doesn't this feel strange?

90
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:04,899
We're on standby in our
regular clothes.

91
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,059
We can't wear our uniforms,
we can't even train.

92
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:13,873
The crazy thing is, our superiors
are armed to the teeth.

93
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,033
We're inside the walls,
not on the front lines.

94
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,217
Who are we even fighting?

95
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,672
No idea, maybe they're just
scared of bears.

96
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:28,218
Yeah right, bears.
- You can fight bears with guns.

97
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,691
I think I hear footsteps.

98
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,930
What?
- Shut it, Sasha.

99
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,393
Are you trying to say that
Titans are coming?

100
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,078
That's only possible if
Wall Rose has been breached.

101
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,414
What's wrong, Miche?

102
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:59,128
Tomas, you need to get out of here.

103
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,934
Take three messengers with you.

104
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:04,041
Warn the others.

105
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:09,729
The chance of Titans hiding among
the 104th Cadet Corps is slim.

106
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:14,435
Multiple Titans are approaching
from the south.

107
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:18,201
Wall Rose has been breached.

108
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,888
I'm not kidding, I hear something.

109
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,298
Is everyone here?
- What is it, Nanaba?

110
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:31,210
We've got company.
About 500 meters south.

111
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,915
Titans are approaching.

112
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,694
There's no time to put on
your equipment.

113
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,004
I want everyone on horseback.
Evacuate everyone in the vicinity.

114
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,434
Get to it!
- The south?

115
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,426
But that's…

116
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,789
Are we certain the wall
has been breached?

117
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:54,004
I'm sorry, but lunch is
going to have to wait.

118
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:01,166
Miche.

119
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:05,964
Nine, in that group over there.

120
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,723
They must have come
through Wall Rose.

121
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:22,416
Damn it, we didn't even get
the chance to find out what those things are.

122
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:25,332
Now it's too late.

123
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,257
Humanity has lost, this is the end.

124
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,726
Not if I have anything to say
about it. We're not done yet.

125
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,743
Not yet. We only lose if we give up.

126
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,611
Remember that.

127
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,277
As long as we can still fight,
we haven't lost yet.

128
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,607
Once the Titans reach the forest,
we split up.

129
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,593
I want four separate teams.

130
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,315
With both recruits and soldiers.

131
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:06,201
On my signal, we scatter.

132
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:10,320
Alert the citizens, do not
engage in combat.

133
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:13,126
Which of you knows this
area well?

134
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,472
I do. My village is to the north.

135
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:19,336
I know this area like the
back of my hand.

136
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,140
Conny too, tell him.

137
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,786
What's wrong?
- My village…

138
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:31,211
My village is to the south,
that's where the Titans are coming from.

139
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,498
I can help, but after that…

140
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,601
Let me go home.

141
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,815
Alright, guide the southern team
and then go to your village.

142
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,545
Yes, sir.
- I'm coming with you.

143
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,339
Are you crazy? They'll be everywhere.

144
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:56,129
You think I care?
I'd do the same for you, right?

145
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:59,169
How about you? You coming too?

146
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,342
Of course, wouldn't miss it
for the world.

147
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:12,627
As you can see, this day marks
a low point in human history.

148
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:16,887
Pay attention. This is the moment
to give it your all.

149
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,419
Don't lose heart.

150
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:21,712
They're through the forest.
The enemy's right behind us.

151
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,265
Scatter, now!

152
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,976
Ride as fast as you can.

153
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,432
No, they've started running.

154
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:54,405
Gelgar, take command
of the southern team.

155
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:55,931
Sir?

156
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:59,313
Understood.

157
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,833
Is he using himself as bait?

158
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,756
I'm going after him, I can help.

159
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:06,621
Stay here, we can't afford
to lose anyone else.

160
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,270
Have some faith.

161
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:12,494
That man's almost as good
as Captain Levi.

162
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,304
He'll be fine, count on it.

163
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,213
Another fight?

164
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:04,562
It wasn't my fault,
they were making fun of me.

165
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:09,117
Of course, Mikasa came to
your rescue again?

166
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:11,469
Thanks, Mikasa.

167
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,661
We don't hit everyone
who's mean to us.

168
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,988
As an adult, you have to
choose your battles.

169
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,197
Being strong means knowing
when to hold back sometimes.

170
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,786
Protect Mikasa once in a while.

171
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,804
It fell, here.

172
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:26,104
Get some sleep, you must be tired.

173
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,205
No, I'm okay.

174
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:32,509
That thing has seen better days.

175
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:37,588
I'll get you a new one if
I can find one.

176
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,577
Eren, Mikasa.

177
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:49,239
The Titans have breached Wall Rose.

178
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,868
They're coming.

179
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,245
Why can't they just
leave us in peace?

180
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,270
Can you go?

181
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:07,455
As if I have a choice.

182
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:12,760
If I may, it was a wise
decision to entrust Miche

183
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,419
with leading the 104th.

184
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,481
If anyone can handle it, it's him.

185
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,191
Yes…

186
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:39,465
Let's hope so.

187
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,783
Only four left.

188
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,127
No, don't risk it.

189
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:03,066
I've bought us enough time.

190
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,252
Still, I can't help but worry
about that Abnormal.

191
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:10,785
Look at it, easily over 17
meters tall.

192
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:15,508
Gigantic.

193
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,488
I've never seen one
with fur before either.

194
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:22,924
It's just wandering around,
why isn't it attacking me?

195
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,016
Definitely an Abnormal, but…

196
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:31,727
There you are.

197
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,132
Seems I don't need to wait
until sundown after all.

198
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,274
It went for the horse?

199
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,762
Come on.

200
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:32,294
Hold on.

201
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:55,425
You must not have heard me.
I said hold on.

202
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:03,327
May I ask what that weapon is?

203
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,657
That thing around your waist,
the one that lets you fly.

204
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:21,813
I believe we speak
the same language.

205
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:25,307
Perhaps you're just too
afraid to answer?

206
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,451
I see you use swords as well.

207
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:34,740
Fascinating. That means you know
about our weak spot.

208
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,285
Oh well, I'll just take this.

209
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,369
Not yet, we only lose
if we give up.

210
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,869
As long as we can still fight…

211
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:15,480
As long as we can still fight…

212
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,459
we haven't lost yet.

213
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,484
Oh, you're free to move again.

214
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,976
Stop, please.

215
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,264
Oh, so you can talk.

216
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,961
What an incredibly clever idea.

217
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:46,276
Translation and resync:
OhItsStefan

218
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:51,741
Out of nowhere, Titans have
appeared within Wall Rose.

219
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:56,253
The recruits of the 104th Cadet
Corps scramble to warn everyone.

220
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,705
Meanwhile, Eren and the others
rush to save them.

221
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:04,893
After returning to her
hometown…

222
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,406
Sasha is forced to confront
her past.
