{MAD MEN [1x01].
SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES

5
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,416
MAD MEN

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,127
A term adopted in the late
1950s as a term for

7
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,755
executives of
advertising agencies on Madison Avenue.

8
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,716
It was to their credit.

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,449
Did you call out to me?

10
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,704
Yes.
Do you have a fire?

11
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,920
A fan of Old Gold, yes?

12
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,090
From this page Lucky Strike.

13
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,759
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you smoking Old Golds?

14
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,804
Excuse me, sir.
Is Sam bothering you?

15
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,265
He is sometimes talkative.

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,726
No, actually
we were having a conversation.

17
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,728
Is that acceptable?

18
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,438
Shall I bring you another drink?

19
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,190
Yes.
Again, the same thing.

20
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,443
Let it be old fashioned.

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,613
Clearly you need to relax
after spending all night here.

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,615
I think you do.
I don't know myself.

23
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,074
But what's the point?
The low tar content?

24
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,119
These new filters?
Why exactly Old Gold?

25
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,996
We used to get them during service,

26
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,706
carton per week for free.

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,458
So you're used to them, right?

28
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,959
Yes.

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,211
It's a habit.

30
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,087
I couldn't convince
you to another brand,

31
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,840
say, to my Lucks?

32
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,384
I love my Old Golds.

33
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,094
Well,
let's say that tomorrow

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,848
some plague of tobacco will come
and it will eat all the

35
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,475
Old Golds on the planet?

36
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,310
This is a sad story.

37
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,729
A tragedy, to say the least.

38
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,649
Would you stop smoking?

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,901
I think I would find something.

40
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,237
I love smoking.

41
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
"I love smoking."
That's a very good one.

42
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,740
My wife hates it.

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,118
In Reader's Digest they write,
That it kills.

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,663
Yes, it has flown around my ears.

45
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,250
Women love their magazines.

46
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,837
They do.

47
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,160
You were afraid you would wake me up, huh?

48
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,620
Am I interrupting something?

49
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,206
No.

50
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,836
You're lucky I'm still working

51
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,796
And I'm all alone.

52
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,840
How are you doing?

53
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,341
They came up with something they call

54
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,968
Grandmother's Day.

55
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,304
This will keep me busy
drawing puppies

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,890
for a few months.

57
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,017
Can I give you a hint?

58
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,602
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

59
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,938
Because I know most of
of your ideas.

60
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,900
I have problems with cigarettes.

61
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,903
So you really came to talk.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,654
The trade commission is trying to crack down

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,239
with our health assurances.

64
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,158
I subscribe to Reader's Digest.

65
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,911
Same concerns you had 5 years ago.

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,287
You were able to cope.

67
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,538
I know I slept better

68
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,665
With the knowledge,
That the doctors were smoking.

69
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,000
Here's the thing.

70
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,794
The whole "safer cigarette" campaign
is over.

71
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,922
No doctors, no credentials,

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,300
No non-cough inducers,
sinus relief,

73
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,344
containing little tar and nicotine
filtered cigarettes.

74
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,970
Nic.

75
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,598
All I have is a stiff box,

76
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,602
As well as "4 out of 5 dead people
choose your brand."

77
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,187
Is this the moment when I say:

78
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,897
"Don Draper is the best

79
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,526
advertising speculator in the world,
and his big, strong brain

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,030
finds a way,
to lead the sheep to the slaughterhouse"?

81
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,992
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

82
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,410
Will you try to convince me or not?

83
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,121
Midge, I'm serious.
I don't have anything.

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,165
I'm finished,
and they will eventually find out.

85
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,250
Next time,
when you see me,

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,586
a group of young executives will
kick me in the ribs.

87
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,965
That's a nice picture.

88
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,927
What are you covering?

89
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,056
Nine different ways,
to say:

90
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,518
"I love you, grandma."

91
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,789
We should get married.

92
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,709
Do you think she would be
make a good ex-wife?

93
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,044
I'm serious.

94
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,671
You have your own business.

95
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,341
You don't mind,
what time I come.

96
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,053
What size Cadillac are you taking?

97
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,346
Do you know the rules.

98
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:52,227
I don't make plans for the future,
nor do I make breakfasts.

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,442
Sterling meets in nine hours
with people from the tobacco industry,

100
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,403
and I don't have anything.

101
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,197
People love to smoke.

102
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,492
And you, the Trade Commission,
or Reader's Digest

103
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,996
you can't do anything
to change that.

104
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,170
A certain kid comes
to my office every day.

105
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,256
You can see where he wants to officiate.

106
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,176
Is he handsome?

107
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,197
Twenty-third.

108
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,573
No rush.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,075
Dude, can you take a longer route?

110
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,077
I really like the view here.

111
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,745
Are you going to Campbell's bachelor party?

112
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,124
Yes, I want to be there before they tie an
an anchor around his neck and throw him into the sea.

113
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,376
Apparently, she's a pretty girl.

114
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,504
Who needs this?

115
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,801
Why did you do it?

116
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,803
They will probably assign it to one of us.

117
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,304
So she will know,
what awaits her.

118
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,557
You have to make them aware,
what kind of man you are.

119
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,350
Then they will know,
what kind of girls to be.

120
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,478
I have a feeling that we won't be
going to your bachelor party.

121
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,690
Yes, compared to Campbell,
I'm a good boy.

122
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,358
Excuse me, is he expecting you?

123
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,945
He's not expecting anything.

124
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,532
Honey, don't be afraid,
I will get home safely.

125
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,325
I have an important meeting right now,

126
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,703
So why don't you go
shopping or something?

127
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,079
Take your mother out to dinner.

128
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,831
Tell her it was my idea.

129
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,541
Wow.
It's quite good.

130
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,335
Honey, it's just a bachelor party.

131
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,130
No, I really don't know,
what they have planned,

132
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,382
But given the
the creativity of the minds here,

133
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,636
we'll probably end up
at a screening of "My Fair Lady."

134
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,180
You know what?

135
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,056
I'll stop by and see you,
when I get home.

136
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,476
Your mother can check,
what I have behind my fingernails.

137
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,062
Of course I love you.

138
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,567
I'm finally giving up my life,
to be with you, right?

139
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,363
What a great girl.

140
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,743
I'm telling you guys,
she stole my heart.

141
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,163
And her old man is stuffed.

142
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,540
Here we have the executive floor.

143
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,667
It should be in order,
but it isn't,

144
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,419
So you'll find employees
responsible for the customer

145
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,130
and the creators,
mixed with each other.

146
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,299
- Please don't ask the difference.
- Sure.

147
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,052
If you follow my example,
you might be able to avoid mistakes,

148
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,178
That I made here.

149
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,890
- Hi, Joan.
- Such as this one, for example.

150
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,393
- So how many trains did you take?
- Only one, but I got up early in the morning.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,229
In a few years,
thanks to good moves,

152
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,314
you'll be living in the city
just like the rest of us.

153
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,274
Of course, if your moves
turn out to be really good,

154
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,195
you will be living in the countryside,
without going to work at all.

155
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,113
You will officiate here,
across the hall.

156
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,741
For the time being, we will both
deal with Mr. Draper.

157
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,243
I don't know what your intentions are,

158
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,953
But don't overdo the perfume.

159
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,163
Keep a bottle of something in your desk.

160
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,873
Mr. Draper drinks dry.

161
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,751
Also, invest in aspirin,
patches,

162
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,878
As well as a needle and thread.

163
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,882
- Rye whisky is from Canada, right?
- Better find out.

164
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,551
He can pretend,
That he needs a secretary,

165
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,761
But mostly they're looking for someone

166
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,638
Between the mother and the waitress.

167
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,475
And sometimes...

168
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,313
Go home,
take a paper bag,

169
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,232
and cut holes in it for eyes.

170
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,817
Put it on your head,
undress,

171
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,735
and look at your reflection in the mirror.

172
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,490
Identify your strengths and weaknesses,
and be honest about it.

173
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,993
I always try to be honest.

174
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,620
Very good.

175
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,248
Try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

176
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,374
Looks complicated,

177
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,210
But the man who designed it,
made it simple enough for a woman.

178
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,295
I hope so.

179
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,630
During the lunch break
Buy a box of chocolates,

180
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,674
a dozen cloves,
as well as a bath salt.

181
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,885
- I'll explain later.
- Thank you, Mrs. Holloway.

182
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,762
You are really wonderful,
taking such care of me.

183
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,264
Call me Joan.

184
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,893
And listen,
don't get me wrong,

185
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:01,810
But a girl like you,

186
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,687
With those little,
cute little ankles,

187
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:07,357
won't be reigned in.

188
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,568
What's more, men love scarves.

189
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,446
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

190
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,822
And also Mr. Sterling.

191
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:14,823
How are you doing?

192
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,743
Hello, girls.

193
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,747
You look poorly.
Long night?

194
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,665
It's all about tobacco, isn't it?

195
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,000
I keep thinking about it.

196
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,627
Yes, I hope so.

197
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,046
Lee Garner, his father,
as well as the entire Lucky Strike family

198
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,298
will be here at 16.

199
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,091
Are you worried?

200
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,384
No.

201
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,428
If I was worried,
I would ask what you have,

202
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,181
But I don't do that,
because I accept that this is the case,

203
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,475
Which means,
that it's you who should be worried.

204
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,062
So you came here,
to watch me dress up?

205
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,855
No, I wanted to be sure,
that you are here.

206
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,857
Body.
Give me half an hour,

207
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,401
and I'll take care of the rest.

208
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,029
How to put it?

209
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,657
Have we ever hired any Jews?

210
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,283
Not in my time.

211
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,036
And that's the number.
That's not what I had in mind.

212
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,538
We have an Italian.

213
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,289
Salvatore, my art director.

214
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,458
- That's not going to work.
- I'm sorry.

215
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,627
Most Jews work
in Jewish companies.

216
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,795
Yes, I know.

217
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,630
Selling Jewish products to Jews.

218
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,756
This is very good.

219
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,217
The idea is that at 11 we meet
Menken's Department Store,

220
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,345
and I would like us to have someone
who would make them feel comfortable.

221
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,224
Should I go to the deli
and bring someone in?

222
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,394
You missed the button.

223
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,722
BREAKING NEWS
DONALD FRANCIS DRAPER

224
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,901
Look at you, little one.

225
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,694
Still want to get into that bikini?

226
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,779
Summer is coming.

227
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,575
Without medical assurances,
all we have is a white box

228
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,661
With a red eyelet.

229
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,455
This was posed by my neighbor.

230
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,708
Believe me,
he always looks well rested.

231
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,251
Of course, he doesn't smoke.

232
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,461
He was holding a pencil in his hand.

233
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,130
Knowing these guys,
a small dose of sex appeal would have been better.

234
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,674
You can draw a woman
in a bathing suit

235
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,800
Next to your guest?

236
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,968
A sexy girl?

237
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,053
I can do it.

238
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,721
Work with a real model.

239
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,973
Love my job.

240
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,517
When it comes to sexy girls,

241
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,352
Are you going to Pete's bachelor party?

242
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,103
I'm not good at these blocks.

243
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,438
Are you telling me that?

244
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,689
This is so embarrassing.

245
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,274
If a girl shakes
it in my face,

246
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,945
I want to be alone,
to be able to act.

247
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,781
Shall we have a drink before the meeting or after?

248
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,158
Or before and after?

249
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,119
So is that what this is about?

250
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,120
Relax?

251
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,914
Don't treat me rough.

252
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,165
This is your art.

253
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,668
I thought it was worth a try.

254
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,753
/Greta Guttman came
/to see you.

255
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,421
- Let her in.
- Great.

256
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,801
Now we're going to listen to the man of science.

257
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,305
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,
both of you seem to be more relaxed

258
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,807
Than I expected.

259
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,643
Have you prepared a surprise
for the tobacco people?

260
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,936
I'm doing my own research.

261
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,313
If you plan to continue
medical certificates,

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,525
you will only be provoking
future government interference.

263
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,901
We need to be on guard.

264
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,028
- Here's your slogan.
- The medical issue is over.

265
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,530
- We understand that.
- Yes, it's finished.

266
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:44,074
Apt choice of words,
considering,

267
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,493
That people are convinced,
That cigarettes are poisonous.

268
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,078
If we can't convince them
That this is not the case,

269
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,497
I believe that my recent research
has provided a solution.

270
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,792
We can still suggest that cigarettes
are part of American culture,

271
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,711
or are too good,
to throw them

272
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,880
Or most interesting,
demanding their own rights.

273
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,507
Basically, if you love risk,
you love to smoke.

274
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,718
We can put on the package
corpse skull and tibias.

275
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,469
I like this.

276
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,013
Before the war,
when I was studying

277
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,848
Under Adler's tutelage in Vienna,
we assumed,

278
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,892
That what Freud called the
desire for death,

279
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,643
is as strong a drive as

280
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,146
reproduction and craving.

281
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,647
Freud, right?

282
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,191
What agency is he from?

283
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,525
We are to believe,

284
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,569
That people are living,
guided by certain principles,

285
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,280
and secretly they think
about something completely different?

286
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,990
That's idiotic.

287
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,700
Please listen to me,
Ms. Guttman.

288
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,285
Doctor.

289
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,828
Dr. Guttman.

290
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,998
Psychology can be
great at a cocktail party,

291
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,876
But as it happens,
that people were buying cigarettes,

292
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,878
Before Freud was born.

293
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,214
The question is not,
why people should smoke,

294
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,258
But why people
should smoke Lucky Strike.

295
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,719
Suggesting that our customers have...

296
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,845
What did you call it?

297
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,639
The desire to die?

298
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,682
I just don't see it
On the billboard.

299
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,143
What about the fact that Reader's Digest writes,
That they are dangerous?

300
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,938
They also wrote,
That Bambi is the book of the century.

301
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,022
They have no evidence.

302
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,899
There is conclusive evidence,
that none of these

303
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,902
limiting the effects of
of smoking systems

304
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,780
has some impact on the amount of
incidence of lung cancer.

305
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,406
Please give me the damn report.

306
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,450
I think you will find it convincing.

307
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,826
Yes, certainly.

308
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,121
It is to you that we owe all
our medical credentials.

309
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,832
- That's true, Mr. Draper, but I...
- Has anyone else seen this?

310
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,251
Of course you haven't.
These are your papers.

311
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,670
And well.

312
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,631
I don't want to hear any more about it.

313
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:27,386
I'm sorry, but your approach
seems perverse to me.

314
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,513
Good luck at the meeting.

315
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,267
I'm sure,
That it will go smoothly.

316
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,941
Sal, I'm going to have a drink now.

317
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,023
Mr. Draper.

318
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,942
Sorry.

319
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,527
Mr. Draper.

320
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:30,574
Sorry to wake you up,
but Mr. Campbell is waiting outside.

321
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,367
He doesn't know that I'm sleeping here,
doesn't he?

322
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,913
- No, sir.
- That's good.

323
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,997
Who are you?

324
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,667
I'm Peggy Olson,
a new employee.

325
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,217
Can you go over there and keep him busy with something?

326
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,677
I know it's my first day

327
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:55,891
and I don't want to give the impression of being uncooperative
to cooperate, but do I have to?

328
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,185
I know what you mean.

329
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,688
I brought you some aspirin.

330
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,319
Let him in.

331
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,446
You look poorly.

332
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,615
Ready to pander
To the Jewish traders?

333
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,951
It's hard to bear you
first thing in the morning, Pete.

334
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,786
No one ever complained.

335
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,372
Speaking of which,
who is your friend?

336
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,706
She's a new employee.

337
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,500
You always get the new ones.

338
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,127
Management rakes in all the bonuses.

339
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,504
Where are you from, baby?

340
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,798
Miss Deaver's School of Secretaries.

341
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,383
Primary.

342
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,804
But I was asking about where you live.
Do you belong to the Amish community or what?

343
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,932
No, I'm from Brooklyn.

344
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,517
So now you're in the city.

345
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,435
It won't be a sin,
if we see your legs.

346
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,146
If you pull in your belly a little,
maybe you'll look like a woman.

347
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,523
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

348
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,567
Hey, I'm not done yet.

349
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,485
Going up.

350
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,695
That will be all.

351
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,113
Peggy, right?

352
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,114
Yes.

353
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,616
It's already time for your meeting at 11.

354
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,618
I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Campbell.

355
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:01,498
Manners left him while he was still in college.

356
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,169
She's a little
too young for you, Draper.

357
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,337
The future Mrs. Campbell
is very lucky.

358
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,047
- When are you getting married?
- Sunday.

359
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,091
Did Ken tell you about tonight's
bachelor party?

360
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,259
Well, sure.

361
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,011
So can I be the first
try my hand with it?

362
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,097
Apparently she has taken under water
more sailors than the Arizona.

363
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,599
How old are you, Pete?

364
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,017
I just turned 26.

365
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,895
I bet the whole world looks
Like one big bra strap,

366
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,938
waiting,
for you to take care of it.

367
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,940
You have a gift of words, Draper.

368
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,276
Campbell, we're both guys,
so I'll be honest.

369
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,029
Christ, are you already sleeping with her?

370
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,281
Advertising is a very small world,

371
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,408
and when you defame the reputation

372
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,328
staff girls,
on her first day of work,

373
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,079
you make,
it even smaller.

374
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,582
Keep it up,
and even if you get my post,

375
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,584
you will never be in charge here.

376
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,252
You will die in this corner office.

377
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,463
A middle-ranking executive,
With a bit of hair on his head,

378
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,758
With whom women go home
By mercy.

379
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,010
Do you want to know why?

380
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,889
Because no one will like you.

381
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,313
Here are our miracle workers.

382
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,689
Of course you know Pete Campbell,

383
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,192
your referent, if you decide to
to use our services.

384
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,777
And the handsome man is Don Draper,

385
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,612
the best creative executive
in New York.

386
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,113
Or at least under this roof.

387
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,990
I am very pleased to meet you.

388
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,826
- I'm very sorry about that.
- I'm Rachel Menken.

389
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,579
Sorry.
I was expecting ...

390
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,665
You expected me to be a man.

391
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,793
Just like my father.

392
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,587
And you?

393
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,048
Don, you don't recognize David Cohen

394
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,550
From the art department?

395
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,176
Ah yes!
David.

396
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,304
One of the rising stars
At Sterling Cooper.

397
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,014
How about a seat?

398
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,141
Ms. Menken,
we'd love to hear what it's all about.

399
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,811
Great.

400
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,896
Very subtle.

401
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,189
Isn't that your shirt?

402
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:54,111
I had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found it.

403
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,205
CENTRAL
MEDICAL CENTER

404
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,759
You must be Peggy Olson.

405
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,221
Joan Holloway sent you here.

406
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,890
She's a great girl.
How is she doing?

407
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,474
She sends her regards to you.

408
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,018
She is a cheerful grandmother.

409
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,395
It must be hilarious
working with her.

410
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,857
Yes, it's amazing.

411
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,027
Try to get comfortable.

412
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,487
Relax.

413
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,623
I can see in the papers,
As well as on the finger,

414
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,333
That you are not married.

415
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,834
That's right.

416
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,755
And are you interested in
In contraceptive pills?

417
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,131
Yes, I wanted to...

418
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,674
There is no reason to be upset.

419
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,135
Joan recommended this place,
as I will not judge you.

420
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,304
There is nothing wrong with,
That a woman is practical,

421
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,932
when it comes to the possibility of
sexual activity.

422
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,142
Please spread your legs.

423
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,810
Enjoy.

424
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,896
However, as a doctor,
I prefer to think,

425
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,940
That putting a woman in such a situation,

426
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,985
will not turn her
into some kind of counter.

427
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:21,490
Bring your pussy closer.
I won't bite.

428
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,414
But be warned,
That I will take them away from you,

429
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,167
If you abuse them.

430
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,546
It's for your benefit, really.

431
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,757
The fact is,
That even in our time,

432
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:43,053
easy women do not find husbands.

433
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,765
I understand,
Dr. Emerson.

434
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,394
I really am a very
responsible person.

435
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,896
I am sure,
that you are not one of those women.

436
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,940
But Joan...

437
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:59,570
Just kidding.
You can get dressed.

438
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,407
I'll write you a prescription for Enovid.

439
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,534
It costs $11 per month,
but please don't think about it,

440
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,828
That you have to let go
left and right,

441
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,247
just for that,
So that it doesn't go to waste.

442
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:13,542
Please forgive my French.

443
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,337
Don is trying to say,
that thanks to

444
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,298
diversity of media,
including airtime

445
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,425
During The Danny Thomas Show,
if you can afford it,

446
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:22,968
we could really
raise awareness.

447
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:26,305
Then a 10% discount coupon,
in selected ladies' magazines,

448
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,432
will increase the number of new female customers.

449
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,225
When we attract them to the store,

450
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,477
the rest...

451
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,229
depends on the lady.

452
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,231
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old.

453
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,775
We share a wall with Tiffani.

454
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,904
Really, a coupon?

455
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,198
Miss Menken, coupons work.

456
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,866
I think your father would agree
to this strategy.

457
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:51,580
Perhaps, but he is not here,
as we recorded our worst year ever.

458
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,207
So it seems to me,
that my opinion

459
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,543
is the most important right now.

460
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,754
Ms. Menken,
why did you come here?

461
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,172
There are a dozen other agencies,

462
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,884
better suited to your needs.

463
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,845
If I would like,
that a guy from the same

464
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,389
village as my father,
handled my account,

465
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,391
I wouldn't go anywhere.

466
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,895
Their research also pointed to coupons.

467
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,813
It's not just the research,
Ms. Menken.

468
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,105
Housewives love coupons.

469
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,024
I'm not interested in housewives.

470
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,401
Then what kind of people do you want?

471
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,779
I want people like you,
Mr. Draper:

472
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,698
People who don't care about coupons,
regardless of whether they can afford them.

473
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,576
People who come to the store,
Because it's expensive in the store.

474
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,496
Clearly our visions
are very different from each other.

475
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:36,834
Yes, such as, for example, that,
That the customer is always right.

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,294
Gentlemen, I really thought,
that you could afford something better.

477
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,214
Sterling Cooper is regarded
as an innovative agency.

478
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,799
This is really a miss.

479
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,051
Don, please.
Don't get carried away with your emotions.

480
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,637
We can always discuss this.

481
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,515
What to discuss?
This idiotic idea that people will come

482
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,142
To a store they've never been to,
because it's more expensive there?

483
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,644
With Chanel it works.

484
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,396
Menken is not Chanel.

485
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,897
You are full of shoes.

486
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,734
Don wanted to say,
That Chanel is a very different place.

487
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,029
It's French,
European ...

488
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,115
And not another
Jewish department store?

489
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,117
Indeed.

490
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,495
You were right, Roger.
This place is full of charm.

491
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,581
- This is absurd.
- Don.

492
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,833
I will not allow,
a woman to address me like that.

493
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,254
This meeting has come to an end.
Good luck to you, Ms. Menken.

494
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,557
Hey, Don,
I don't blame you.

495
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,058
That was an overkill.

496
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,101
Money and education

497
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,895
don't add decency to people.

498
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,815
Roger will not be happy,
so you should be happy.

499
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,734
I will not pretend,
that I don't want your post,

500
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:47,487
But you were right.
I deal with people badly,

501
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,866
unlike you.
Not including this meeting, of course.

502
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,994
So I'm counting on you to help me somehow.

503
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:57,873
There's plenty of room at the top.

504
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,628
Listen, I'm sorry,
that I was hard on you earlier.

505
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,255
It's because of that damn tobacco.

506
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,215
You'll think of something.

507
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,176
For a guy like you,
I would go into battle blindfolded,

508
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,802
and I wouldn't be the first.

509
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,889
Am I right, my friend?

510
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:15,849
Maybe let's reduce the pace a bit.

511
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,686
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

512
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,110
Fuck you.

513
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,446
Dr. Emerson is great, isn't he?

514
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,240
He seemed nice.

515
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,366
He lives in South Hampton.

516
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,117
I'm not saying I've been there,

517
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,203
But it is beautiful.

518
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,413
Don't get upset,
but it is

519
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,791
the most nervous place in the office.

520
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,043
You and your boss rely on an eager

521
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,255
and cheerful cooperation with a few
skillful employees.

522
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:50,968
It's not allowed to growl, shout,
nor be sarcastic toward them.

523
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,889
And most importantly,
always be humble.

524
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,396
I know you are busy,
but there is a new one among us.

525
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:06,525
Peggy, this is Marge,
Nanette and Ivy.

526
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,402
I have something for you.

527
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,155
Something as a welcome gift.

528
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,949
Isn't that cute?

529
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,034
Knowing Joan,
I'll get the candy.

530
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,327
Joan, that's not fair.

531
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,912
You know she needs to lose 4 kilos

532
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,455
Before the Christmas party.

533
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,832
To me, you look great.

534
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,208
That's because I'm not moving.

535
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,752
You can always drop by
to visit us, sunshine.

536
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,962
Who does she work for?

537
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,380
For Don Draper.

538
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:29,756
Did they get rid of Eleanora?

539
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,008
She left.

540
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,718
Draper was not interested.

541
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,887
She could not be reached.

542
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,513
A little rogue.

543
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,056
I see that you have your hands full.

544
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,516
It's better not to be intrusive.

545
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,601
Nice to meet you guys.

546
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,894
You have nice legs.

547
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,272
I bet they will please Mr. Draper,
if he can see them.

548
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:50,194
Sterling Cooper. Thank you for waiting.
Who do you want me to connect with?

549
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,945
I don't know,
what we should do,

550
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,531
to satisfy these government intruders.

551
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,909
They tell us,
To make safer cigarettes,

552
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,785
we do,
and suddenly here

553
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,495
it's not enough.

554
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,539
I might as well live in Russia.

555
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,626
That's right.

556
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,590
This morning I had a phone call

557
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,051
From my rivals
From Brown & Williamson,

558
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,553
and were sued by the federal government

559
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,472
because of health assurances.

560
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,098
Yes, we are aware of that,
Mr. Garner,

561
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,352
But you must realize,
that through the manipulation of the mass media,

562
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,856
people get the impression,
That your cigarettes are associated

563
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,692
With certain fatal diseases.

564
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,985
Manipulation of the media?

565
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,238
After all, that's what we pay you for.

566
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,864
Our product is fine.

567
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,241
I smoke them myself.

568
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,492
My grandfather used to smoke them.

569
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,369
He died at the age of 95.

570
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,828
He was hit by a truck.

571
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,956
I understand.
But our hands are tied.

572
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,084
We can no longer advertise,
That the Lucky Strikes are safe.

573
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,335
So what the heck,
should we do?

574
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,547
We have already set up our own
tobacco research center,

575
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,423
To bury this rumor.

576
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,425
And that's a very good start.

577
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,929
But it may not affect sales.

578
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:03,392
Don, I think,
it's time for you to go.

579
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,811
So...

580
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,522
I tried to ...

581
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,316
think it over...

582
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,735
i...

583
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:29,793
I have always been a lover of
Lucky Strikes, so...

584
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,303
I may have a solution.

585
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,054
At Sterling Cooper
we are the pioneers

586
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,182
an emerging research field,

587
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,559
and our analyses show,
That health risks,

588
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:49,563
associated with your product
is not yet the end of the world.

589
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,482
Every day people use
cars to commute to work,

590
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,526
and some of them die.

591
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,695
Cars are dangerous.

592
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,489
Nothing can be done about it.

593
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,409
You still have to get there.

594
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,786
The same goes for cigarettes,

595
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,830
So why don't we say:

596
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,124
"What about the fact that cigarettes are dangerous?"

597
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,584
"You are a man."

598
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,669
"The world is dangerous."

599
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,338
"Light a cigarette."

600
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:18,300
"You still have to get there."

601
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,178
This is very interesting.

602
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,139
Of course,
If cigarettes are dangerous,

603
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:27,267
- ... would be interesting.
- But they aren't.

604
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,852
Is that your slogan?

605
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:31,688
"You're going to die anyway, so do it with us."?

606
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,357
So true,
widely recognized

607
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:38,695
psychological principle states,
that society has a death wish,

608
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,156
and if only we could
put it into practice,

609
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,282
the market potential is...

610
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,034
What the hell are you talking about?

611
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,577
Are you crazy?

612
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:46,954
I don't sell shotguns.

613
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,622
I'm in the tobacco business.

614
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:49,873
We are selling America.

615
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,751
It's a gift from the Indians, damn it.

616
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,419
Let's go, dad.

617
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,673
Let's get out of here.

618
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,342
The only consolation,
is that at least we know,

619
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,677
That if we have this problem,

620
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:05,180
it affects everyone.

621
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,443
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I say something?

622
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,406
I don't know, Don.
And are you able to?

623
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,618
Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest

624
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,245
did you guys a favor.

625
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:34,168
They let you know that any ad,
brings up the concept of cigarettes and health,

626
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:37,671
will only cause,
that people will think about cancer.

627
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,425
Yes, and we are grateful to them for that.

628
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:45,846
But what Lee Jr. said,
is true.

629
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,514
You cannot give
medical assurances,

630
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,517
Just like your rivals.

631
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,020
So we have a lot of people,

632
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:56,190
who are not saying anything,
that will allow cigarettes to be sold.

633
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,774
Not quite.

634
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,235
This is the biggest advertising opportunity

635
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,905
since the invention of
cereal.

636
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:08,160
We have six identical companies,
producing six identical goods.

637
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,454
We can say whatever we want.

638
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:13,081
How do you make your cigarettes?

639
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,625
I don't know.

640
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,252
Shame.

641
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,755
We are growing seeds
of insect repellent tobacco,

642
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,131
we plant them in North Carolina,

643
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,258
sun shines, grows,
we harvest,

644
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,302
we are drying, toasting....

645
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,805
And there we have it.

646
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,104
LUCKY STRIKE
"BURNED"

647
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,106
But the tobacco of others is also toasted.

648
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:42,361
No.
The tobacco of others is poisonous.

649
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,488
The one from Lucky Strikes...

650
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,407
is toasted.

651
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,701
Gentlemen,
I don't think I need to tell you,

652
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,371
What we have just witnessed.

653
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,040
I guess you have to after all.

654
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,919
The commercial is based
on one thing:

655
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,587
on luck.

656
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:01,964
And do you know what happiness is?

657
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,510
Happiness is the smell of a new car.

658
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,012
It's freedom from fear.

659
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,057
It's a billboard, standing by the side of the road,

660
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:16,687
Which proclaims with encouragement,
That whatever you do,

661
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,982
IS OK.

662
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,695
You are in order.

663
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,037
Baked.

664
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,834
I like this.

665
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,304
And I was already afraid.

666
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,555
I don't know if you were drunk,

667
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:55,601
Or sober,
but it was inspired.

668
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,061
Between you and me,
I took it from the ceiling,

669
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,521
so thank you very much.

670
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,732
You are turning the wrong way.

671
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,484
So when I have you in a lark,

672
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,779
why don't you rethink the presidential campaign?

673
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,990
I don't know myself.
Flags and other wonders?

674
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,408
It's hard work.

675
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,285
I'm going to mess everything up.

676
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,537
Modesty.
It's delightful.

677
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,372
Think about this product:
it's young, handsome,

678
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,373
jacket hero.

679
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,000
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

680
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,377
To convince America,
That Dick Nixon is a winner.

681
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,923
/AMY GOODMAN: Mr. Draper, you have visitors.

682
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:29,635
Can you be clearer, honey?

683
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,970
Apparently you saved the situation.

684
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:32,763
Thank you, guys.

685
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,556
Appreciate it.

686
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,183
I told them,
how amazing you were.

687
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,935
I can still feel the tingling.

688
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,021
I see that you will integrate
at the middle level,

689
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,524
So nothing here for me.
Don, thanks again for your showdown.

690
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,775
I did it with pleasure.

691
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,694
There is some chance,
That you will reconcile with Rachel Menken?

692
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,239
Can you be as charming,
as I described you?

693
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,950
Isn't there enough of my magic
For one day?

694
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,743
It's worth $3 million.

695
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,663
Bitch of a woman.

696
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,123
Peggy ...

697
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,708
Can he bring us more ice?

698
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:02,960
/698 00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:02,7060 Yes, Mr. Draper?

699
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,336
One moment.

700
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,880
Gentlemen, I'm afraid this event
must move elsewhere.

701
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,049
We'll go wherever you want,
but it's 5:15 pm.

702
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,051
The bachelor party is underway.

703
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:12,135
Don't know.

704
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,137
Go ahead, Don.
All hands on deck.

705
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,640
Won't you help us say goodbye to Pete?

706
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,601
Maybe another time.

707
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:26,024
Let's go, guys.
Don will join us later, right?

708
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:36,076
If Greta's research was good,
I would take advantage of them.

709
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,703
What are you talking about?

710
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,247
I'm saying that I had the same report.

711
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,749
And there is no magic machine,

712
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,211
making exact
copies of objects.

713
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,798
I still think,
that she was right.

714
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,138
Have fun, Pete.

715
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:59,099
My congratulations.

716
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,902
I heard that you were amazing
during the meeting.

717
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,906
Fear has a stimulating effect
on my imagination.

718
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:18,702
I wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

719
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,163
And also, you know,

720
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,751
That you interceded for me
at Mr. Campbell.

721
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,681
First of all, Peggy,
I'm your boss,

722
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,809
not a boyfriend.

723
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,853
Second, if you allow
Pete Campbell

724
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,063
browse through my garbage again,

725
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,777
you won't even find a job as a
a sandwich vendor at Penn Station.

726
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,113
He said he left here
his fountain pen.

727
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,991
I didn't know.

728
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,789
I hope you don't take me
for such a girl.

729
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,500
Of course you don't.

730
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,543
Go home.

731
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:08,877
Curl your hair.

732
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,548
Tomorrow we start again.

733
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:18,887
Peggy, I want,
you to make a phone call.

734
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,951
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,
regardless of whether you're carrying drinks.

735
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:44,288
Every 5 minutes.

736
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,874
Let's settle in here.

737
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,750
Just don't look around all night.

738
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,377
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?

739
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,505
Come on, I'm Italian.

740
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:57,467
Is this some kind of event?

741
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,052
How did you do it?

742
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,637
As in automatic.

743
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,348
He pressed the button, and they flew out.

744
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,350
I hope,
that we are not disturbing you.

745
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:06,476
Of course not.

746
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,853
I took the best place.

747
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,188
What do we drink?

748
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,565
More of what makes you,
That makes you look so beautiful.

749
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,108
I love this property.

750
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,570
It's hot, loud
and full of men.

751
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:19,781
I know what you mean.

752
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,378
Oh my god.
I can barely feel.

753
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,714
I get the impression,
That you are like this every day.

754
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,007
I like to laugh.

755
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,259
Is that true?

756
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,761
Stop.

757
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,138
You said you like to laugh.

758
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,431
I'm serious.

759
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:45,682
That's too...

760
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,809
Too delectable.

761
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:48,894
I told you to stop.

762
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:52,981
- What are you doing?
- You know very well.

763
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,067
You know what, girls?
I think we should go.

764
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:56,568
Stop.

765
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,655
You're hurting me.

766
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,659
I will be polite.

767
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:08,080
Buy the girls what,
what they want.

768
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,294
So what do you do?

769
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,964
You're looking at the best
advertising professionals in New York.

770
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,925
At the top of the world.

771
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,617
For Ms. Special Mai Tai,

772
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,829
As well as pure whisky.

773
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:56,336
So you plan to
to regale me with drinks,

774
00:38:56,503 --> 00:39:00,424
And convince me,
what a terrible mistake I'm making.

775
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,593
Nice drink.

776
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,305
You made trouble for yourself, didn't you?

777
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:09,850
I shouldn't have
lose my temper

778
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,935
and I certainly should not have
treat you

779
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,312
As someone inferior to the customer.

780
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:16,315
Apology accepted.

781
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,151
So you understand.

782
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,069
Now it's like this.

783
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:25,032
That was so really nice.

784
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,700
Hear all these things,

785
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:30,746
That I assumed,
That people are thinking.

786
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:34,917
I'm really not that bad.

787
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,544
I've been living in a lot of tension.

788
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,506
Other.

789
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,051
It doesn't matter.

790
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,970
It does.

791
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,434
So without making things worse,

792
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,061
can I ask you a personal question?

793
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:57,356
Don't you want,
me to have a second drink first?

794
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:00,692
Why aren't you married?

795
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,903
Are you asking what's wrong with me?

796
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,072
You are a beautiful,
educated woman.

797
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,573
You don't think,
that getting married

798
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,367
and starting a family
would give you more happiness

799
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,661
Than all the tribulations,
that go along with

800
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:14,665
With fighting people
like me?

801
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,625
If I wasn't a woman,

802
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:20,295
I could ask you the same thing,

803
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,631
and if I wasn't a woman,
I wouldn't have to choose

804
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,300
Between putting on an apron,

805
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,928
and the pleasure of transforming
my father's store

806
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,471
In a way,
that always seemed right to me.

807
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:33,016
So that's the point.
You're not going to get married,

808
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,977
Because business is a pleasure for you.

809
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,105
That, and also...

810
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,110
I have never been in love.

811
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,363
She will not get married,
because she has never been in love.

812
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,575
I seem to have used this once,
to sell nylons.

813
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:53,495
For many people, love
is not just a slogan.

814
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:54,580
Speaking of love,

815
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,373
you mean
A heart pierced by an arrow,

816
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,542
When you can't eat and work,

817
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:02,629
and you run away to get married

818
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,591
and make babies.

819
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,759
You didn't feel it,

820
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,261
because there is no such thing.

821
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:12,764
Your concept of love was
invented by guys like me,

822
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,434
To sell nylons.

823
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,561
Is this true?

824
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:20,898
I'm pretty sure about that.

825
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,524
You are born alone,
and that's how you die,

826
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,152
and this world only imposes
you only a lot of rules,

827
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,528
so that you would forget about it,

828
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:29,656
But I never forget.

829
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,910
I live like there's no tomorrow,

830
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,747
because, after all, there isn't.

831
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,418
I didn't realize until now,

832
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:46,715
That a man's life
must be just as hard.

833
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,843
Excuse me?

834
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:51,803
- Mr. Draper ...
- Don.

835
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,266
Mr. Draper, I don't know,
what you really believe in,

836
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,812
But I do know how it feels,
to feel constrained,

837
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,106
to be detached,

838
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:08,946
to see the whole world functioning
according to other people's rules.

839
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,864
You have something,

840
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,910
Which tells me,
That you also know this.

841
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:22,125
I don't know if that's true.

842
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,212
Another drink?

843
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,422
No.

844
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:32,386
But you can tell your
boss that I've been charmed.

845
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,726
So I suppose,
that we will see each other again.

846
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:45,232
I'll be back in the office on Monday morning,
for a real meeting.

847
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:48,110
I'm happy.

848
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,418
We're not buying anything.

849
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,004
In fact,
for the first time today,

850
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:09,756
I'm not trying to sell anything.

851
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,675
Does Peggy live here?

852
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:14,261
One moment.

853
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,733
Do you know him?

854
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,486
All right, Marjorie.
We're working together.

855
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:32,738
He's really drunk.

856
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,908
All right, Marjorie.

857
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,203
So.

858
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,206
what are you up to?

859
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:45,918
Nothing special.
I'm sitting in my room and listening to music.

860
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,587
I'm getting married on Sunday.

861
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,423
Heard.

862
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:56,887
You probably think I'm a wimp.

863
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,182
Why are you here?

864
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,611
I wanted to see you
tonight.

865
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,616
With me?

866
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:21,119
I had to see you.

867
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,879
Marjorie.

868
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:33,340
Yes, Peg?

869
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,552
I'm going to go to bed now.

870
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:02,513
I called the office.

871
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,724
They said you left.

872
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:09,895
I didn't want to bother you.

873
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:11,688
No harm done.

874
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:16,652
I assumed,
That you stayed in the city again.

875
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:20,989
A full plate is waiting in the oven.

876
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,246
Unless you're not hungry.

877
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,831
I'm not.

878
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:35,796
I'll be right back.

879
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,007
Don't move from here.
